Uses MediaPipe to detect a face in an image the allows you to combined it's depth estimation with those from Zoe and Midas.
The 3d viewer has Y pointing the opposite direction from Blender, so ya hafta spin it.

See https://huggingface.co/spaces/shariqfarooq/ZoeDepth and https://huggingface.co/spaces/drafff/dpt-depth-estimation

Caveat: I may be conflating "Intel/dpt-large" and "Midas"...
